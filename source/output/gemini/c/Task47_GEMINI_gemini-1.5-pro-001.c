// This task typically requires third-party libraries for networking and HTML parsing, 
// which are not part of standard C.
// Including and using such libraries can be complex and vary based on the chosen library.

// Please specify if you'd like me to provide an example using a specific library like:
// * libcurl (for networking)
// * libxml2 (for XML parsing; suitable for well-formed HTML)
// * You'll also need a database library (e.g., SQLite) if you want to interact with a local database directly.
